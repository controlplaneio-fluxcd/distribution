    The guide will show you how to orchestrate the GitOps delivery of applications and infrastructure workloads
    across multi-tenant clusters while catering to the different teams and stakeholders within an organisation.
    And how to automate the update of Helm OCI Artifacts
    to the staging environment while enabling gated promotion to production by leveraging GitHub Pull Requests.

    ---

    The guide will show you how to leverage on GitHub fine-grained Personal Access Tokens and Kubernetes
    RBAC for segregating responsibilities
    and access between platform, services, and application teams while maintaining security and compliance
    in a multi-tenant environment.
