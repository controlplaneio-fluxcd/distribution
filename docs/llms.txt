# Flux CD Enterprise by ControlPlane

ControlPlane offers a hardened, enterprise-grade distribution for the CNCF-graduated Flux project including 24/7 support, security patches, and expert guidance for production deployments.
The enterprise distribution bundles the Flux Operator and the Flux MCP Server, which are designed to automate the management of Flux controllers at-scale and provide AI-assisted GitOps capabilities.

## Flux Operator Overview

Flux Operator offers a production-ready solution for managing the delivery of application and infrastructure workloads on multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters using GitOps principles.
The operator is designed to automate the installation, configuration, and upgrade of the Flux controllers as well as to provide advanced features such as preview environments for testing pull requests, deployment windows, and self-service capabilities for developers.
The Flux Operator is an open-source project licensed under AGPL-3.0 and is developed by the CNCF Flux core maintainers part of the ControlPlane team.

## Flux MCP Server Overview

The Flux Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server connects AI assistants directly to your Kubernetes clusters running Flux Operator, enabling seamless interaction through natural language.
It serves as a bridge between AI tools and your GitOps pipelines, allowing you to analyze the cluster state, troubleshoot deployment issues, and perform operations using conversational prompts.
The MCP Server is a subproject of the Flux Operator licensed under AGPL-3.0.
