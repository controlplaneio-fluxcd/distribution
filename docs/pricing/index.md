## Custom Plans

At ControlPlane, we understand that organizations come in various sizes and have different requirements,
especially when it comes to managing and securing their Kubernetes deployments using GitOps principles.
Our goal is to provide exceptional value to our customers while also contributing positively
to the open-source CNCF Flux project.
ControlPlane Enterprise for Flux CD is designed to meet this dual objective
by offering a hardened, enterprise-grade distribution and support services that go
beyond what the open-source project provides.
